      <description>This tutorial-like article will demonstrate how to handle file uploads on Apollo Server and stream them to Amazon S3 or, optionally (but not preferably), to your server&amp;rsquo;s filesystem.
Before we go on, I assume you have basic familiarity with S3 and already have read on this subject on the Apollo docs.
NOTE: for the sake of simplicity, I have kept things to a very minimum (most of the time).</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Fábio. And this is my blog on (good and bad) software development.
I&amp;rsquo;m a brazilian software developer based on Juiz de Fora, Brazil, where I mostly engineer software for an emerging fintech called SouFan.
I believe that knowledge is empowering (and often life-changing), and that good knowledge should be at everyone&amp;rsquo;s reach. The (hopefully good) knowledge shared in this blog is a humble effort to contribute towards that goal.</description>
