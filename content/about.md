Hi, I'm FÃ¡bio. And this is my blog on (good and bad) software development.

I'm a brazilian software developer based on Juiz de Fora, Brazil, where I mostly engineer software for an emerging fintech called [SouFan](http://soufan.com.br/).

I believe that knowledge is empowering (and often life-changing), and that good knowledge should be at everyone's reach. The (hopefully good) knowledge shared in this blog is a humble effort to contribute towards that goal.

I am also a user, tinkerer, creator and supporter of open-source tehcnologies. You can reach out to me and check some of my works on [Github](https://github.com/fhpriamo), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fhpriamo) or [Dev.to](https://gitlab.com/fhpriamo).

Be welcome!
