If you'd like to report any errors in code or errors in writing (I'm sure there are lots of them), make suggestions of any kind, ask for permission to use some content, or even just reach out and say "Hi!", please, [open an issue at Github](https://github.com/fhpriamo/blog/issues).

If you'd like to contribute directly with some content, [PRs](https://github.com/fhpriamo/blog/pulls) are also welcome.

Thanks!
